# Custom binaries

I have a few custom binaries that I use to facilitate my workflow.

## Tmux Sessionizer

This script allows me to search through my mostly used directories thanks to [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). When I hit enter, it will open the directory in a new tmux session if it doesn't exist, or switch to it if it does.
